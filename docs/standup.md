- standup (1)

  General overview about how the standup is going to look like:
  Every stand up is going to take place after class if the class takes place at 9 am, or before class if it happens to take place at 13 pm. It is possible to attend the stand ups online if not possible to be attending in person

  The first stand up always takes place on a monday

  - phase 1: check up

    in this first phase, we will take a look at if the tasks from the weekend have been completed. Weekend tasks will only be assigned to members if they have not been completed in the week where they were assigned. If the tasks have not been completed during the weekend, they will also be marked as available tasks for the upcoming week to be worked on.

   - phase 2: task planning and assigning 

   here we are going to check which tasks we want to have completed the upcoming week. We can do this based on checking which milestones we are currently working on, and how many of the user stories need to be completed for said milestones. Previously mentioned weekend tasks will have the priority here, and will be assigned to members that they have been assigned to previously. this means that said members will have less tasks they can complete said week. if the member does struggle a lot with the tasks, they will be upon request assigned to another member, and the member who the weekend tasks will then be assigned to, will forfeit their tasks to the member who gave his weekend tasks away.

    - phase 3: planning the week

    After every task has been assigned to every member, we will take a look at when we can hold the next standup. this might be two or even one day after this standup, heavily dependant on how much work needs to be done.

- standup (2)

  This is a short standup, where the logboek master goes by every single logboek, and checks on how much tasks the person has completed up until that point. This will give us an insight in how far everyone is, and if tasks can be assigned to different people based on how much work they have already done, or if they have lightweight tasks


  - standups outside of the planned once

  If, someone is struggling with their tasks, it is crucial to let other members know in the whatsapp groupchat. that way, we can hold a small standup, where we check if we can give the task to someone who is willing to take on the challenge. It is possible that nobody has the capacity to take on extra tasks, and in that case the person will need to set the task aside, and work on other tasks. An extra standup will be held on friday, where we assign the task to someone as a weekend task.
