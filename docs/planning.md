This document will serve as a template for an idea i had regarding how we can go about working on this project

- chapters
  - workflow
    - design
    - documentation
    - sprints
  - standup
  - review
  - actual weekly plan


- workflow
  - sprints
    My idea is that we can work using the Scrum method, where we pick a certain few milestones from the knelpunten which we have spotted in the descirption of the project, and also based on the responses that we will be getting from the teachers on our questions. There is going to be a total of 6 sprints for this project, each one lasting a few weeks
