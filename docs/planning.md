- workflow

  - design

  principles to follow: https://canvas.hu.nl/courses/39814/files/4315389?module_item_id=1049651

  We will be making a project design based on the different strategies based in this book. This should currently be enough to get a basic idea of what we want to do, so we can later decide how we want to go about it and create tasks for everyone to work on. The design itself will also be an enabler story, with each of the different patterns being a task on their own.

  - documentation
    - project plan: https://canvas.hu.nl/courses/39895/assignments/294412?module_item_id=1046090
   
      we are going to follow whatever is described within the project plan. We will use the same layout as we did for the front end project, where each chapter will have their own markdown file. The documentation itself will be an enabler story, with each part being a task on its own. They will be big tasks, but they should fit within the 4 hour task limit.


  - sprints
    
    My idea is that we can work using the Scrum method, where we pick a certain few milestones from the knelpunten which we have spotted in the descirption of the project, and also based on the responses that we will be getting from the teachers on our questions. There is going to be a total of 6 sprints for this project, each one lasting a few weeks.

    Each sprint will as, previously mentioned, have a set of described milestones that we have set out to complete. Everyone will get around 10 tasks a week to complete for the        milestones. it is most logical in my opinion, to give assign entire user stories to team members, as then they can work efficiently on each of the tasks within their user          stories. User stories may be divided between one or more members depending on the ammount of tasks they might have or the ammount of tasks that have already been completed in      the prior week.

- standup
  
  standup described in detail: https://github.com/PawelKubosz/VR-Escape-Room/blob/main/docs/standup.md

  We will be having a total of 2 stand ups each week. I do not see the point in having daily standups as it is possible and very likely for tasks to be worked on over the period of a few days, so checking upon each persons progress on their tasks would not be needed.


- review

  review described in detail:

  Each week there will be one review, which will take place on the last day that we have to be in school. That could be on Thursday or Friday. We will hold a bigger sprint review at the end of each sprint

- Logboek

  Every single team member is going to have a markdown file where, every single week, they will update it with their own tasks. It will look the same as the ones we had for the KPN project, except in my opinion, it is not needed for us to also note down every single pull we have. We trust each other, so we can just put a cross behind each of the tasks that we have completed. We will use this template for each week:
  
  | Week N | Tasks                   | Completed tasks                   |
  |--------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | 1      | #23 #15 #66             | #23 #15 #66                       |
  | 2      | #93 #98 #91 #67         | #91 #67                           |
  | 3      | #103 #109 #117 #140 #65 | #65                               |

- roles
  I have decided it will be best if each of the members has one role which oversees the project, that way, instead of if i were to do all of the tasks, it will be easier to keep everything in control, and have everyone be in control of the project instead of just one person. It will also be easier to spot mistakes and give proper feedback to eachother

  Here are the different roles that i have came up with thus far:
  - scrum master (controls the majority of GitHub and oversees the projectboard)
  - logboek master (controls if everyone has a fair ammount of tasks, and if the tasks dont look bigger than 4 hours of work)

    PLEASE let me know if i can add any other tasks. Like maybe something during the reviews or standups
