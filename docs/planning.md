This document will serve as a template for an idea i had regarding how we can go about working on this project

- chapters
  - workflow
    - design
    - documentation
    - sprints
  - standup
  - review
  - actual weekly plan


- workflow

  - documentation
    - project plan: https://canvas.hu.nl/courses/39895/assignments/294412?module_item_id=1046090
   
      we are going to follow whatever is described within the project plan. We will use the same layout as we did for the front end project, where each chapter will have their own markdown file. The documentation itself will be an enabler story, with each part being a task on its own. They will be big tasks, but they should fit within the 4 hour task limit.


  - sprints
    
    My idea is that we can work using the Scrum method, where we pick a certain few milestones from the knelpunten which we have spotted in the descirption of the project, and also based on the responses that we will be getting from the teachers on our questions. There is going to be a total of 6 sprints for this project, each one lasting a few weeks.

    Each sprint will as, previously mentioned, have a set of described milestones that we have set out to complete. Everyone will get around 10 tasks a week to complete for the        milestones. it is most logical in my opinion, to give assign entire user stories to team members, as then they can work efficiently on each of the tasks within their user          stories. User stories may be divided between one or more members depending on the ammount of tasks they might have or the ammount of tasks that have already been completed in      the prior week.
